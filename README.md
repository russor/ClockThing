> An Arduino Alarm Clock for LILYGO LILY Pi ESP32

ClockThing lets you have a clock that uses NTP to set the time, and fetches iCal feeds to handle timezones and when to alarm.

## Hardware

I'm currently using this with the LILYGOÂ® TTGO LILY Pi with the ILI9481 screen. If you have the other screen, change config.h.

## Building

This should build with PlatformIO
